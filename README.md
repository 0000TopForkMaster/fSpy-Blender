This is the official [fSpy](https://fspy.io) importer for [Blender](https://blender.org).

## Getting started

* [Download the latest version](https://github.com/stuffmatic/fSpy-Blender/releases). Make sure you download the file called `fSpy-Blender-x.y.z.zip`.
* Install the add-on by pointing Blender to the downloaded zip file (__don't__ unzip the file before installing)
* Go to File > Import > fSpy

## ⚠️ Important note for mac users

Safari seems to unzip downloaded zip archives automatically by default. Since the add-on must be installed as a zip file, you have to do one of the following

* Disable the auto-unzip behaviour and download the add-on again
* Manually re-archive the automatically unzipped folder and point Blender to this file when installing
